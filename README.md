bfi

A simple and for fun Brainfuck Interpreter.  I wrote this entirely for fun and for no purpose but to see how quickly I could hack together a working Brainfuck interpreter.  It ended up taking about 1.5 hours of coding to complete this.  I may or may not conitinue to update this.

Syntax: `./bfi -f filname [-m memorysize]`
