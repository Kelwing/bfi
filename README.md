A simple and for fun Brainfuck Interpreter.  I wrote this entirely for fun and for no purpose but to see how quickly I could hack together a working Brainfuck interpreter.  It ended up taking about 1.5 hours of coding to complete this.  I may or may not conitinue to update this.

Syntax: `./bfi -f filname [-m memorysize]`

To build:

1. Make and enter a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
2. Run CMake to generate build files `cmake ..`
3. Run make! `make`
